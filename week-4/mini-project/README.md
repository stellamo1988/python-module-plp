# Mini Project - PLP Bootcamp

In this project, you are tasked to create a program that automates searching for a word definition in a dictionary. Follow the instructions to implement

Dictionary Project is provided [here](https://github.com/mutemip/dictionary-data): 

> Download using this command in Linux on the same directory \
> `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mutemip/dictionary-data/refs/heads/master/data.json`

1. We should have a data source (Download from the link above)
2. Learn how to load json data into a python dictionary
3. Create a function that returns a definition of a word
4. Consider a condition that the entered word is not in a dictionary
5. Consider input from user having different cases – upper/ lower case or mixed eg: RAIN/rain/RaIN
6. Make your dictionary program more intelligent incase users input a word with wrong spelling the program should be able to suggest the word that might be intended.
e.g. pott instead of pot or rainn instead of rain. Tip: use difflib library here
